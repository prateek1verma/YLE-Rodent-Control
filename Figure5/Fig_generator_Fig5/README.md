# Figure 5 plot generation

Plotting scripts for the Figure 5 multi-patch comparisons.

## Key scripts
- `Fig5a.R` – Generates panel a.
- `Fig5b.R` – Generates panel b (additional plots stored in `Fig5b_all_plots/`).
- `Fig5c.R` – Generates panel c.
- `Fig5d.R` – Generates panel d.

Run these scripts after the corresponding data-generation steps. Output PNGs are written to this folder.
