# Figure 1 plot generation

Scripts here convert processed simulation outputs into individual Figure 1 panels.

## Key scripts
- `Fig1b_plot.R` – Builds the Fig. 1b panel.
- `Fig1c_plot.R` – Builds the Fig. 1c panel.

Both scripts expect the folders produced by the data-generation (eg `rel0p01_fy0p80_pq0p00_fl0p00_fs1p00_mu0p97_j0p25_c0p93`) to be in the same directory as the fig generation scripts. These files export PNG panels in the same directory.
