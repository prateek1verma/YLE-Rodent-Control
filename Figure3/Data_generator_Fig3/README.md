# Figure 3 data generation

Contains MGDrivE runs for contrasting target assumptions in Figure 3.

## Key scripts
- `main_YLE_vary_rel_fy_target_fertility_haplosufficient.R` – Runs simulations under haplosufficient target assumptions.
- `main_YLE_vary_rel_fy_target_fertility_partial_haploinsufficient.R` – Runs simulations with partially haploinsufficient targets.
- `generate_YLE_inheritance_cube.R` – Prepares the inheritance cube shared across runs.

Run the relevant script from this directory; outputs are saved alongside the inputs for use in plotting.
