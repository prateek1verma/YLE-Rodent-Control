# Figure 3 plot generation

Scripts that assemble the Figure 3 panels from simulation summaries.

## Key script
- `Fig3_plots.R` – Loads processed data, generates each panel, and exports `Fig3.pdf`.

Ensure simulation outputs from `Data_generator_Fig3/` are present before running the plotting script.
