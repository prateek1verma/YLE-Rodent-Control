# Figure 2 plot generation

Contains the plotting script for Figure 2.

## Key script
- `Fig2_plot.R` – Reads the summary CSV output from `Data_generator_Fig2/` and renders the figure panel (saved as `Fig2.png`).

Ensure the processed data files exist before running the plot script to avoid rerunning long simulations.
