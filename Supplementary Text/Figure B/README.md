# Supplementary Figure B: Fixed-release sensitivity

Sensitivity analysis with fixed release relative fitness assumptions.

## Contents
- `main_Latincube_YLE_fixed_rel.R` – Latin hypercube sweep with fixed relative release parameters.
- `generate_YLE_inheritance_cube.R` – Builds the inheritance cube for runs.
- `FigB_Sensitivity_BRT.R` – Processes outputs and generates the figure.
- `mgdriveYLE_sweep_Latin4_fix_rel_3per/` – Stored simulation outputs for this analysis.

Run the main script to regenerate simulations, then execute `FigB_Sensitivity_BRT.R` to rebuild the figure.
