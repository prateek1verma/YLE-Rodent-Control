# Supplementary Figure F: fsRDDL/fRIDL comparison

Simulations and plots comparing fsRDDL and fRIDL strategies.

## Contents
- `main_fsRRDL_para_sweep.R` – Executes parameter sweeps.
- `generate_fRIDL_inheritance_cube.R` – Builds the inheritance cube for fRIDL.
- `FigF_fsRDDL.R` – Generates the supplementary figure (output saved as `FigF.png`).

Run the main script to regenerate simulations, then execute `FigF_fsRDDL.R` to recreate the figure.
