# Supplementary Figure E: Carrying capacity sensitivity

Simulations and plots examining the influence of carrying capacity on fertility-targeting YLE scenarios.

## Contents
- `main_YLE_vary_K_target_fertility_haploinsufficient.R` – Runs simulations varying carrying capacity.
- `generate_YLE_inheritance_cube.R` – Builds the inheritance cube.
- `FigE.R` – Generates the supplementary figure (output saved as `FigE.png`).

Run the main script to regenerate simulations, then execute `FigE.R` to recreate the figure.
