# Supplementary Figure D: Target fertility sweeps (5-year releases)

Simulations and plots for fertility-targeting YLE releases over five-year windows.

## Contents
- `main_YLE_vary_rel_fy_target_fertility_haploinsufficient_5yrs.R` – Runs the primary simulations.
- `generate_YLE_inheritance_cube.R` – Builds the inheritance cube.
- `Process_large_data_create_summary_csv_files.R` – Summarises outputs.
- `FigD.R` – Generates the supplementary figure (output saved as `FigD.png`).
- `mgdriveYLE_sweep_5yr_release_target_fertility/` – Stored simulation outputs.

Run the main script to regenerate simulations, summarise results, then execute `FigD.R` to rebuild the figure.
