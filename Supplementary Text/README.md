Contains additional simulations and figures that accompany the main text. Each subfolder corresponds to a supplementary figure.

## Subfolders
- `Figure A` – Latin hypercube sensitivity analysis and BRT analysis for all parameters including varying release values.
- `Figure B` – Sensitivity analysis with fixed release size assumptions.
- `Figure C` – Target viability sweeps with haploinsufficient effects.
- `Figure D` – Target fertility sweeps over 5-year release windows.
- `Figure E` – Varying carrying capacity for fertility-targeting YLE.
- `Figure F` – Suppression efficacy and population peaks as a function of release size for fsRRDL.
- `Figure G` – Suppression efficacy and population peaks as a function of release size for YLE.
- `Figure H` – Transient population overshoot during the initial phase of the YLE suppression campaign.
